# team-portfolio-project

**Team Portfolio** — a small static website built by a student team to demonstrate professional Git and GitHub collaboration workflows.

## Project Purpose
The goal of this assignment is not only to create a functional portfolio website, but primarily to show mastery of collaborative source-control practices: creating and using feature branches, writing clear Conventional Commits, opening meaningful Pull Requests, performing peer code reviews, resolving merge conflicts correctly, and deploying the final code to GitHub Pages.

## What’s included
- `index.html` — main page listing team members and links to individual profile pages  
- `firstname-lastname.html` — one profile page per team member  
- `assets/` — optional CSS and images  
- `README.md` — project description, team retrospective, and submission notes
